`discord-twitter-webhooks` is an automated tool that sends tweets from Twitter to Discord using webhooks.

## Features

- Send tweets from Twitter to Discord using webhooks.

## Installation

You have two choices, using [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/thelovinator/discord-twitter-webhooks)
or [install directly on your computer](#install-directly-on-your-computer).

### Run with Docker

This is the recommended way to install the bot.

Docker Hub: [thelovinator/discord-twitter-webhooks](https://hub.docker.com/r/thelovinator/discord-twitter-webhooks)

- Data is stored in /home/botuser/.local/share/discord_twitter_webhooks in the container.
- The container runs as the bot user with UID 1000 and GID 1000, this means your directory must be owned by UID 1000 and
  GID 1000.
- The server runs on port 8000.

### Install directly on your computer

This is not recommended if you don't have an init system (e.g., systemd)

        - You should use the latest version.
        - You want to add Python to your PATH.
        - Windows: Find `App execution aliases` and disable python.exe and python3.exe
    - [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/master/#installation)
        - Windows: You have to add `%appdata%\Python\Scripts` to your PATH for Poetry to work.

  the [ZIP](https://github.com/TheLovinator1/discord-twitter-webhooks/archive/refs/heads/master.zip).
    - If you want to update the bot, you can run `git pull` in the project folder or download the ZIP again.
